				<h2>Web Design</h2>
				<p>X1mediatools is proud to build your Custom Professional Website! You must have a professional-looking site if you want to be taken seriously. Since many consumers now search for information online prior to making a purchase at a most stores, your site may be the first chance you have at making a good impression on a potential buyer. If your site looks like it was designed by a barrel of colorblind monkeys, your chance at making a good first impression will be lost.<br /><a href="http://x1mediatools.com/website-design/">Read More</a></p>

				<h2>Logo Design</h2>
				<p>A logo is what helps customers remember the company or product, and is often what brings them back. The right logo can be one of the strongest marketing tools as it is a consistent image that consumers become familiar with, and that provides clarity to consumers and suppliers as to what the brand or product is. Examples of good logos are those that can be easily differentiated form other logos, and ones that are easily recognized due to their unique typography or distinctive coloring. The job of a logo designer is to provide a new and innovative way to express the key message of a company through a recognizable image.<br /><a href="http://x1mediatools.com/logo-design/">Read More</a></p>

				<h2>Video Production</h2>
				<p>Video is so engaging that websites with a video on the homepage are viewed longer and have more sales than websites with only a photo and text. We can also do opener videos (using your logo or company name) if you have a series of videos or branding that you would like to include with a bunch of videos. Contact us for details and pricing!<br /><a href="http://x1mediatools.com/video-production/">Read More</a></p>
